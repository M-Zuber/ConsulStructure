# ConsulStructure â€“ Simple no-dependency configuration

Sometimes you just want very simple configuration that doesn't suck, without bringing
in a whole set of packages for it, so you can hit go as quickly as possible.

## Quickstart

ConsulStructure ships as a source-code package, so you don't add more pressure to your
dependency graph.

Install from nuget.

```
Install-Package ConsulStructure
```

## Credits

This project is inspired by the excellent functionality provided by the Go-based [consulstructure](https://github.com/mitchellh/consulstructure/]
